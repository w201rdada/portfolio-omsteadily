## A beginning.

Data Visualizations have evolved in the era of printed text, and tools to imagine, create and experience three- or four-dimensional visualizations live in the awkward translation space of two dimensions.

## A middle.

Several possibilities present themselves:
* Three-dimensional scatterplots of human-scale dimensions to delineate correlations across three variables, with you standing at the origin.
* Geographic data - stand like a giant over the Bay Area, with county or zipcode-level data hovering over their respective space.
* Social data - rather than a two-dimension scrolling feed, a 360-degree representation of posts and status updates.

It is this last one I would want to focus on first:  a Twitter space where tweets fall around you in real-time like rain.  Their relative size could be a function of the number of followers the poster has.  Their speed could be a measure of their virality.  Even their coordinates could contain information - NLP could put positive tweets in front of you, negative ones behind you.  A soundscape could reflect the volume of tweets in space at a given time, such that you experience mild tension when in a controversial space.  Touch a tweet to pause it in midair, expand the picture or play a video clip.

## An end.

The data is available via the Twitter API; the primary challenge here is translating it into a virtual space.  Toolsets like WebVR are making it easier for people other than professional game developers to build things, but they are still crude.  Ideally, this would be a collaboration of someone proficient in something like Unity with a data scientist.
