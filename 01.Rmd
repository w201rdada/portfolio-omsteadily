## Approach the weight

The success of programs like CrossFit and Peloton have shown how effective informal competition can be as a motivator for exercise.  This works well for monomodal movements that can be effectively measured like a stationary bike, but breaks down as more movements enter the picture and apples can no longer be applied to apples - a tall person has an advantage in something like rowing, and a disadvantage in something like a thruster.  A big person might have a much more difficult time than a little person with bodyweight movements, but might be able to lift more absolute weight. What is needed is an equivalent measurement that can be applied across many domains, beyond simple reps and time.  Physics has given this to us, in the form of joules - a measure of energy.  The problem is the individual math required to calculate how many joules an individual has expended over a workout.

## Pick up the weight

The first step of the solution is simple image recognition:  an algorithm to recognize how much a barbell weighs simply by looking at it.

```

Once the algorithm knows how much a barbell weighs, it can figure out how far it has moved.  From there it's simple math to figure out how much energy was expended to move it.

The logical next steps are to estimate bodyweight by looking at a person (or allow them to simply tell you), so that bodyweight movements such as push-ups or pull-ups can be calculated.  Given a large enough training set, the algorithm could recognize not just movements (ie, that's a deadlift) and count reps for you, but could qualify the form of the movement (ie, that's a poor deadlift, and repeating it could result in injury).
