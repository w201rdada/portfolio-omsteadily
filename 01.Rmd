## Approach the weight

The success of programs like CrossFit and Peloton have shown how effective informal competition can be as a motivator for exercise.  This works well for monomodal movements that can be effectively measured like a stationary bike, but breaks down as more movements enter the picture and apples can no longer be compared to apples - a tall person has an advantage in something like rowing, and a disadvantage in something like a thruster.  A big person might have a much more difficult time than a little person with bodyweight movements, but might be able to lift more absolute weight. What is needed is an equivalent measurement that can be applied across many domains, beyond simple reps and time.  Physics has given this to us, in the form of joules - a measure of energy.  The problem is the individual math required to calculate how many joules an individual has expended over a workout.

There are two potentials targets for clients and decision-makers here: gyms and CrossFit.  Gyms represent a walled-garden approach - they control all the equipment within their four walls, and therefore present a far simpler target for training data - you could use scales, or QR-coded weights, for example.  However they also have a wealth of machines that perform a similar function and a clientele that is traditionally not very interested in competition at the gym.  CrossFit, on the other hand, is founded on competition (every workout has a score and a leaderboard), has an inherent mistrust of machine-based fitness.  As an organization, they also have strong motivation here:  every year they sponsor the CrossFit Games, which is fed by an open competition in which thousands of athletes need to be evaluated by human judges.  An objective measurement would save a lot of effort.

The CrossFit route represents a greater challenge but also a greater opportunity.  The wider variety of movements and equipment makes for a much taller mountain to climb, but that can be addressed by limiting to the most common and standardized options at first.  In the long run, having this capability available to anyone with a smartphone has much more potential as a business than in marketing it solely to gyms.

## Pick up the weight

The first step of the solution is simple image recognition:  an algorithm to recognize how much a barbell weighs simply by looking at it.  

Here are a few images of loaded barbells from Google Images:
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://static1.squarespace.com/static/566d92eedc5cb43cee298f46/t/5895d94a59cc680c3ca015e5/1486215499032/barbell.jpg?format=1500w')
```
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://halevylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/8d19c03bb4d05a87c78615454d7398f7.jpg')
```
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://iwsmt-content-ok2nbdvvyp8jbrhdp.stackpathdns.com/792012045712cciOV.jpeg')
```

The good news is that weights are largely standardized around just a few increments.  This places some limit on the possible variations in the training set.  The training parameter is also pretty simple: total weight on the bar.

There are, of course, challenges, primarily around variation in plate manufacture and bar loading. To keep things simple to start with, it would be best to use Olympic plates (which are colored and standardized) and standard loading.  It also helps that all the weights are already in kilograms.  These weights are very popular, particularly with anybody who does olympic lifting, so should not represent a sizable (or at least risky) equipment expense.

With a complete set of weights and barbells, it should be relatively easy to assembly a corpus of training data - simply pictures of loaded bars at all angles and weights, tagged with the total weight on the bar.

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ff/6c/36/ff6c36cd44e62bee75a1c6d0650e5568--plate-sets-workout-equipment.jpg')
```

The second step involves estimating the distance the bar has travelled in a rep.  Given the standardized dimensions of the plates, you should be able to extrapolate distance, although there may be some challenge in defining when a "rep" is complete (although strictly speaking this isn't necessary - as long as you can differentiate between up and down, you can simply tally the total distance the bar travels to calculate work.  Counting reps would be preferable.)

Once you know the weight and how far it has moved, you can calculate the work. In the simplest example of picking a weight up off the floor, $W = F*D$ or Work = Force times Distance.  Force can be calculated as $F = m * a$, or mass times acceleration ($9.8m/s^2$, ie, gravity).  My shoulders are 1.68 meters off the ground.  If I clean 25kgs to my shoulders, I have performed 411.6 joules, compared to someone 4 inches shorter who has done the same weight, same movement, but 25 fewer joules of work.

As a short-term proof-of-concept, the goal would be to point your phone at someone doing a set of something simple like a deadlift from any angle, and with no other input tell them how much work they performed when complete, in both joules and watts.

## Add weight; pick it up again

The logical next steps are:

* to include a wider variety of bars and plates.
* to estimate bodyweight by looking at a person (or allow them to simply tell you), so that bodyweight movements such as push-ups or pull-ups can be calculated.  
* to incorporate angular and horizontal movements.
* to expand beyond barbells into kettlebells, medicine balls, dumbbells, etc.
* to recognize the movements themselves.  Once the algorithm can say "that's a deadlift," the next step is to say, "that's a bad deadlift.  Keep doing that and you're liable to injure yourself."

Eventually, in conjunction with an individual recognition engine (RFID or facial recognition), it should be possible for cameras in a gym to track all movements done by an individual in a workout area and, at the end of a session, provide a detailed report of work done, calories burned, any new personal records set, update relevant leaderboards accordingly and potentially make suggestions or encouragements for the next session.  Obviously there are some privacy concerns there that would need to be addressed and communicated clearly, but it would be an invaluable tool for those willing to participate.
